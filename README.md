### Hello There!

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a software engineer with a love for serving people. Although I have spent 15 years in the coffee industry, I believe great hospitality and service can (and should) be applied to all industries. I am passionate about helping others succeed by sharing my experience and knowledge and showing them the benefits of continuous improvement. I get excited by new challenges and thrive in fast-paced environments where creative thinking is a requirement.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first post-boot-camp project (stay tuned for more details...)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to improve my skills with CSS.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸŽ® Currently playing: Baldur's Gate 3
