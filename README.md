### Hello There!

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a software engineer with a love for serving people. Although I have spent 15 years in the coffee industry, I believe great hospitality and service can (and should) be applied to all industries. I am passionate about helping others succeed by sharing my experience and knowledge and showing them the benefits of continuous improvement. I get excited by new challenges and thrive in fast-paced environments where creative thinking is a requirement.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to improve my skills with CSS.

## Tasker
Tasker is an app I created for my final capstone project at Springboard. It is an odd-job marketplace based on the popular service Task Rabbit. The frontend was created with React and the backend was created with Node, Express, and Postgresql. A link to the hosted application is on the GitHub repository found at the link below.

## Fox Comics
Fox Comics is an eCommerce site built for a fictional, digital comic book retailer. This was my first capstone project at Springboard. The focus of this project was the backend where I utilized Flask, Python, and Postgresql. The frontend was created with an HTML template. A link to the hosted application is on the GitHub repository found at the link below.
